# CPU Scheduling Visualization

## Overview
This project implements various CPU scheduling algorithms and provides a graphical visualization of the scheduling process. It includes the following scheduling algorithms:

- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
- Priority Scheduling
- AG Scheduling (Modified Round Robin)

## Features
- Interactive input for specifying processes.
- Visualization of Gantt charts for different scheduling algorithms.
- Calculation and display of average waiting time and turnaround time.
- Support for custom time quantum in AG scheduling.

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Swing (for GUI)

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Run the `Main.java` file to interactively input processes and visualize scheduling.

## Usage
- Follow the on-screen instructions to input process details.
- View the graphical visualization of Gantt charts for each scheduling algorithm.
- Observe average waiting time and turnaround time statistics.
